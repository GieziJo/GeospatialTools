This Folder contains a version of the algorithm used for the [Global Flood Model (GFD)](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/MODIS_GlobalFloodDatabase) updated to Python 3 and stripped to the minimum.

The goal is the create a flood map based on the GFD algorithm (multi-day thresholding) for any shapefile/geojson (within reasonable size), for any period of time.

Open `HistoricalTimeSeriesForGeometry.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
